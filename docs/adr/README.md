# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory records **significant technical decisions** for Inventra — what was chosen, the
options weighed, and the trade-offs accepted. Format: lightweight [MADR](https://adr.github.io/madr/).

Decisions follow a deliberate principle for this project: **prefer industry standards & best
practice over portfolio-differentiation shortcuts** — use mature, battle-tested libraries unless the
domain genuinely needs custom, and document the trade-off either way.

## Conventions

- One decision per file: `NNNN-short-title.md` (zero-padded, monotonically increasing).
- **Status**: `Proposed` → `Accepted` → (`Superseded by ADR-XXXX` / `Deprecated`). Never edit an
  Accepted ADR's decision; supersede it with a new ADR and link both ways.
- Keep it short: context, options, decision, consequences. Link to PRD/DATABASE where relevant.

> **Mobile ADRs** live in [`docs/mobile/adr/`](../mobile/adr/) (docs web/mobile are separated for
> readability) but keep this **single global numbering sequence** — this table remains the master
> index for every ADR in the repo.

> ADRs are **decisions**, not implementation. Code lands in follow-up work; each ADR notes the libraries
> and the integration points. ADR-0007's refactor (folder regroup + field-key rename) is tracked as
> follow-up work — see PROGRESS.md.
