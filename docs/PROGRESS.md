# Inventra — Progress & Remaining Work

Living checklist of what's built vs. what's left. See [PRD.md](PRD.md) for scope,
[DATABASE.md](DATABASE.md) for the schema, and [ERD.md](ERD.md) for entity relationships.

> **Scope update — PRD v1.1 (Bank Fixed Asset Management).** The product was reframed to a **bank**
> fixed-asset system (context: Bank BTN) and enriched with: inter-office **mutasi**, **stock opname**,
> **BAST** documents, **dual-basis depreciation** (commercial PSAK 16 + fiscal PMK 72/2023), **disposal**
> with gain/loss, **intangible** assets (PSAK 19, fields prepared), **capitalization threshold**, and
> **value-tiered maker-checker** (`approval_thresholds`, SoD per POJK 17/2023 & 18/POJK.03/2016).
> Design docs (PRD/DATABASE/ERD) are updated, and the **bank-FAM schema is now built** — v1.1
> enums/columns are **baked into the initial migrations** (greenfield) + new tables in
> `000015_fam_tables` (see *Database* below and DATABASE.md §6). Architecture decisions from the pivot
> are recorded as ADRs in [adr/](adr/) (**ADR-0001–0009**: testing, logging, config, rate-limit, authz
> build-vs-buy, map, frontend API convention, masterdata split, third-party sign-in). What's already ✅
> predates the pivot and remains valid — the office hierarchy + 3-layer authorization are the foundation
> the bank scope builds on.

> ## ▶ Next session — start here
> 1. ~~**Bring the dev stack up, reset & migrate**~~ ✅ **DONE (2026-06-27).**
> 2. ~~**#6 Kategori Aset screen**~~ ✅ **DONE.**
> 3. ~~**Approval engine + Asset core backend**~~ ✅ **DONE (2026-06-28).**
> 4. ~~**Asset attachments (MinIO)**~~ ✅ **DONE (2026-06-28).**
> 5. ~~**Barcode/QR + label PDF**~~ ✅ **DONE (2026-06-28).**
> 6. ~~**Asset documents (BAST)**~~ ✅ **DONE (2026-06-28).**
> 7. ~~**Authorization admin endpoints**~~ ✅ **DONE (2026-06-28).** `internal/authzadmin` — role CRUD, replace-set permissions/scope/fields, Redis cache invalidation, permission catalog, seed RBAC drift fix, integration tests, OpenAPI spec.
> 8. ~~**Wire Peran & RBAC screen to real `/authz` APIs**~~ ✅ **DONE (2026-06-28).** `useRbac` composable rewritten to `/authz/catalog` + `/authz/roles` + `/authz/roles/:id/permissions`; English DTO; UUID `id` identity; system-role permissions now editable (product decision — lock note reworded, switches active); e2e spec updated against real seeded backend.
> 9. ~~**Wire frontend Data Scope screen** (`/settings/data-scope`) to real `/authz` APIs~~ ✅ **DONE (2026-06-28).** `useDataScope` composable rewritten to `/authz/catalog` (scope_modules, filters `*`) + `/authz/roles` + `/authz/roles/:id/scope`; English DTO; UUID `id` identity; save only changed roles (dirtyIds set); e2e spec added against real seeded backend; orphaned `mock/dataScope.ts` deleted.
> 10. ~~**Wire frontend Field Permission screen** (`/settings/field-permission`) to real `/authz` APIs~~ ✅ **DONE (2026-06-28).** `useFieldPermission` composable rewritten to `/authz/roles` + `/authz/roles/:id/fields`; catalog `assets`+`users` (English field keys); UUID `id` identity; default-allow (no stored policy = view+edit); save preserves other-entity rows + only PUTs changed roles; e2e spec added against real seeded backend; orphaned `mock/fieldPermission.ts` deleted. **Authz-screen wiring trio (RBAC + Data Scope + Field Permission) now complete.**
>    - **TODO — extend field-permission ENFORCEMENT (`FilterView`) beyond `assets`+`users`:** `requests` (approval handler already injects `fieldSvc` + has `requestToMap`; add `ForEntity`/`FilterView` calls), `employees` (needs `fieldSvc`+map wiring), and other masterdata modules. Until then the Field Permission screen configures rules but they only take effect for `assets`+`users`. Add each new entity to `frontend/app/constants/fieldCatalog.ts` once its backend enforcement lands.
> 11. ~~**Wire Audit Trail screen** (`/settings/audit`) to real `GET /api/v1/audit`~~ ✅ **DONE (2026-06-29).** `useAudit` composable rewritten to server-side list (`GET /api/v1/audit`, limit/offset/filter params); gate `audit.view`; entity-type filter from `AUDIT_ENTITY_TYPES` frontend catalog; expandable diff viewer unchanged; orphaned `mock/audit.ts` deleted; e2e spec updated against real seeded backend.
>    - **TODO — actor filter + role/summary/office-name columns are dropped:** the backend audit response has no `role` or `summary` fields, and resolving actor/office **names** needs `user.manage`/masterdata reads that an `audit.view`-only viewer may lack. Revisit if a viewer-accessible actor/office name lookup (or an enriched `GET /api/v1/audit` response) lands.
> 12. ~~**Wire User Management screen** (`/settings/users`) to real `/api/v1/users`~~ ✅ **DONE (2026-06-29).** `useUsers` composable rewritten to server-side CRUD (`GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/v1/users`, limit/offset/search params); gate `user.manage`; role/office/employee pickers from real API lookups; employee picker filtered by selected office; orphaned mock NOT deleted (still imported by `useGlobalSearch` — see §TODO below); e2e spec updated against real seeded backend. **Authz/settings screen wiring batch now complete (RBAC + Data Scope + Field Permission + Audit Trail + User Management).**
>    - **TODO — server-side role/office/status filter dropdowns** dropped pending backend filter-param support on `GET /api/v1/users`; **reset-password** action dropped pending a backend reset endpoint. The office/employee lookup is capped at 100 entries (a searchable async picker is a follow-up if user/employee counts grow).
>    - **TODO — `mock/users.ts` cleanup**: still imported by `useGlobalSearch.ts` for the mock global search. Delete it when `useGlobalSearch` is wired to the real backend `/search` endpoint.
> 13. ~~**Wire Peta Lokasi screen** (`/master/map`) to real `GET /api/v1/offices/map`~~ ✅ **DONE (2026-06-29).** First of the master-data screen wiring batch. `useOfficeMap` rewritten to `GET /offices/map`; types migrated to `MapOffice`/`OfficeTier` (English snake_case DTO); `officeMapMeta` constants (3 tiers: pusat/wilayah/office → Pusat/Wilayah/Cabang); page rebound (lat/lng null-guard, load-error/retry, data-scoped); Leaflet `OfficeMap` component field-rename; e2e spec (`frontend/e2e/master-map.spec.ts`) + component test added; orphaned `mock/officeMap.ts` deleted.
>    - ~~**TODO — `office_types.tier` not yet editable:**~~ ✅ resolved — tier is now editable via Master Data Referensi (`/master/reference`, `office-types` resource: tier select pusat/wilayah/office). Offices whose type has `tier = NULL` still render as Cabang (conservative fallback in `toTier`) until a tier is assigned.
>    - **TODO — map shows empty-state until offices have lat/lng coordinates:** no production seed supplies coordinates. Office coordinates must be entered manually on the Office form (`/master/offices`). Per-office asset count is live (real `asset_count` from `GET /offices/map`) but returns 0 until the asset module is populated.
> 14. ~~**Wire Referensi screen** (`/master/reference`) to the generic reference engine~~ ✅ **DONE (2026-06-29).** `useReference` composable rewritten to real `$fetch` (`/api/v1/masterdata/reference/:resource`); 11 resources fully described (FK pickers: cities→provinces, models→brands; `office-types` `tier` editable via select; `vendors` gains `contact_name` + `address` fields; `is_active` toggle/column hidden for provinces & cities which lack the column; `departments` `code` field restored); `brands` label corrected to "Brand" (matching mockup); engine `typeEnum` + `tier` column wired on backend; orphaned `mock/reference.ts` deleted. **The office map is now meaningful** — office-type tier can be set (pusat/wilayah/office) via Referensi, so the map renders real Pusat/Wilayah/Cabang pins once tiers are assigned. **TODO:** cities and models need at least one province / brand created first (no production seed); empty FK picker shows a warning message.
> 15. ~~**Wire Kategori Aset screen** (`/master/categories`) to `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/v1/masterdata/categories`~~ ✅ **DONE (2026-06-29).** `useCategories` composable rewritten to real `$fetch` (CRUD + `GET /categories/tree` for full unpaginated set); client-side tree ordering, filter/search/pagination retained; `CategoryFormSlideover` repointed to `~/constants/categoryMeta`; load-error/retry; `data-testid="category-parent-select"` added to parent picker; orphaned `mock/categories.ts` deleted; e2e spec rewritten against real seeded backend; mockup comparison verified (8 columns, filter bar with search + 2 selects + active toggle, 4-section slideover — 1:1 match). **Master-data wiring batch complete (Peta Lokasi + Referensi + Kategori Aset).**
> 16. ~~**Wire Pegawai screen** (`/master/employees`) to `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/v1/masterdata/employees`~~ ✅ **DONE (2026-06-30).** `useEmployees` composable rewritten to real `$fetch` (CRUD `/api/v1/employees`, server-enforced `employees` data-scope); `Employee`/`EmployeeInput` English DTO; UUID FK pickers for office (required), department, position with table name-resolution (`officeMap`/`deptMap`/`positionMap`); inline `GET /offices?limit=100` for office options (data-scoped); backend `phone` column added (migration + DTO + query + OpenAPI); `data-testid` added to office/dept/position USelects; e2e spec created (`frontend/e2e/employees.spec.ts`); mockup comparison verified (7 columns, filter bar with search + 4 selects + reset, slideover NIP+status/name/dept+position/office+scope-note/email+phone — 1:1 match). `mock/employees.ts` retained (still imported by `useGlobalSearch` — delete when global search is wired to real `/search` endpoint).
> 17. ~~**Wire Kantor + Lantai + Ruangan screens**~~ ✅ **DONE (2026-07-02).** `/master/offices` (split-panel tree + detail + floors/rooms) wired end-to-end: `useOffices` → `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/v1/offices` (tree built client-side from the flat scoped list), `useFloors` → `/api/v1/floors` (`?office_id=`) + `/api/v1/rooms` (`?floor_id=`) with floor/room updates resending the required `office_id`/`floor_id`. English DTO (`name`/`code`/`is_active`, FK `office_type_id`/`province_id`/`city_id`, `latitude`/`longitude`); form now uses **FK pickers** (office-type/province/city from `useReference`, city filtered by province) + **optional lat/lng inputs** (product decision — enables Peta Lokasi pins; mockup had none); tree icon/colour derived from the office type's **tier** (`tierMeta`). Detail resolves FK ids → names + parent name. Load-error/retry added. `mock/floors.ts` + `floors-mock.spec.ts` + `offices-mock.spec.ts` deleted; `mock/offices.ts` retained (decoupled `MockOffice` type — still used by `useGlobalSearch`). Unit specs (`use-offices`/`use-floors`) + 20-case component spec + real-backend e2e (creates an office type via Referensi, then an office). **Master-data screen-wiring batch now COMPLETE (Peta Lokasi + Referensi + Kategori + Pegawai + Kantor/Lantai/Ruangan).**
>    - **TODO — `mock/offices.ts`:** delete when `useGlobalSearch` is wired to the real `/search` endpoint.
> 18. ~~**Asset transfer (mutasi) — backend module**~~ ✅ **DONE (2026-07-02).** `internal/transfer` (service/executor/handler/routes) wired end-to-end: `asset_transfer` approval executor creates the `transfers` row on approval; `approved → in_transit → received` state machine (`POST /transfers`, `GET /transfers`, `GET /transfers/:id`, `POST /transfers/:id/ship`, `POST /transfers/:id/receive`, `GET /assets/:id/transfers`); receive atomically relocates the asset + records a `bast_transfer` asset-document (optional MinIO file); `transfer.view`/`transfer.manage` + `transfers` data-scope enforced on every verb; OpenAPI documented; 15 tests green. **Frontend Mutasi screen not started — mockup now available at `docs/design/Mutasi Aset.dc.html` (2026-07-03).**
> 19. ~~**Asset disposal — backend module**~~ ✅ **DONE (2026-07-02).** `internal/disposal` (service/executor/handler/routes) wired end-to-end; the `asset_disposal` approval executor was moved out of the asset package into this module, creating the `disposal.disposals` row only on approval with SQL-computed `gain_loss`; BAST attached via the shared asset-documents mechanism (`bast_disposal` doc type, `related_disposal_id`); `disposal.view`/`disposal.manage` + `disposals` data-scope enforced on every verb; `POST /disposals`, `GET /disposals`, `GET /disposals/:id`, `POST /disposals/:id/document`, `GET /assets/:id/disposal`; OpenAPI documented (`Disposal` schema + 5 paths); 9 tests green. **Deferred:** gain/loss GL export + depreciation-derived `book_value_at_disposal` (both wait on the depreciation module). **Frontend Disposal screen not started — mockup now available at `docs/design/Penghapusan Aset.dc.html` (2026-07-03).**
> 20. ~~**Next session — pick the next real step.**~~ ✅ **Picked (2026-07-04): wire the Assets cluster.**
> 21. ~~**Wire Assets cluster** (Katalog/Detail/Form/Label) to real `/api/v1` + real-backend e2e~~ ✅ **DONE
>     (2026-07-04).** `AssetCreatePayload` widened to the full create-form field set; Katalog → real
>     `GET /assets` (server-side list/search/filter, FK name resolution); Detail → `GET
>     /assets/by-tag/:tag` (field-permission money masking, attachments gallery, tab empty-states for
>     Assignment/Maintenance/Depreciation — none of those modules exist yet); Form → create submits
>     `POST /requests` type `asset_create` (maker-checker — **no direct create**), edit is restricted to
>     mutable fields via `PUT /assets/:id`; Label/Barcode → real barcode/label-PDF endpoints. Real-backend
>     e2e (`frontend/e2e/assets.spec.ts`, rewritten): API setup (office/floor/room/category prereqs,
>     unique per run) → submit `asset_create` → approve as a second SoD-eligible user (maker ≠ checker)
>     → UI assertions across Katalog/Detail/Edit/Label + the `/assets/new` form flow (verified via a
>     follow-up API call, left pending/unapproved) + a negative empty-state search. All gates green:
>     backend build/vet/test/integration, Spectral, frontend lint/typecheck/test/build, full e2e suite
>     (57/57).
>     - **Bug found + fixed during e2e verification:** `pages/assets/[tag].vue` co-existed with the
>       `pages/assets/[tag]/` folder, which made Nuxt treat `[tag].vue` as the **parent route** for
>       `[tag]/edit.vue` — without a `<NuxtPage/>` in `[tag].vue`, `/assets/:tag/edit` silently rendered
>       the Detail page instead of the edit form (both via `page.goto` and via clicking "Ubah"). Fixed by
>       moving `[tag].vue` → `[tag]/index.vue` so Detail and Edit are sibling routes. This was a real,
>       previously-unnoticed regression — not a test artifact — so it's called out explicitly here.
>     - **Deliberate deferrals:** Import wizard still mock (no backend bulk-import endpoint yet);
>       Approval screen still mock (only the **submit** side is wired, via this task's `POST /requests`
>       call — the inbox/decide UI is still fixture-backed); asset **delete** is out of scope for this
>       screen — deletion goes through the Disposal screen/module instead; **field "Pemegang" (holder)
>       was dropped from the Form** per user decision — the holder is set via the future **Penugasan**
>       (assignment) module, not at asset creation/edit — Katalog's "Pemegang" column renders "—" until
>       that module lands.
> 22. ~~**Security follow-up (from Task 21 review)** — server-side `amount == payload.purchase_cost`
>     cross-check for `asset_create` on `POST /requests`~~ ✅ **DONE (2026-07-04).** Enforced in
>     `SubmitRequest.validate()` (numeric big.Rat equality; zero when payload has no cost; malformed
>     payload/amount rejected). Unit tests + OpenAPI updated. See the resolved note under *Assets
>     cluster* in §Remaining.
> 23. ~~**Next session — pick the next real step.**~~ ✅ **Picked (2026-07-04): wire the Pengajuan &
>     Approval screen** (candidate (a) below — see item 24). Remaining candidates (see *Remaining*
>     below) for the *next* session: **(b)** build the last core Bank-FAM backend module — **Stock
>     opname** (session + item reconciliation: found/not_found/damaged/misplaced + report), following the
>     same pattern as `internal/transfer`/`internal/disposal` (approval executor where applicable +
>     scoped module + OpenAPI); **(c)** start the **depreciation** module, which several deferred items
>     (disposal book_value, GL export) depend on; **(d)** build the frontend **Mutasi** and/or
>     **Disposal** screens against the now-complete backends — mockups prepared 2026-07-03 for all six
>     v1.1 screens; **(e)** build **Assignment** (check-out/in, and the natural home for the deferred
>     "Pemegang" field) or **Maintenance**; **(f)** wire **global search** backend (`/search`) + drop the
>     last `mock/*` files. Confirm priority before starting.
> 24. ~~**Wire Pengajuan & Approval screen** (`/approval`) to real `/api/v1/requests`~~ ✅ **DONE
>     (2026-07-04).** `app/pages/approval.vue` rewritten off `~/mock/approval` onto `useApproval`
>     (inbox/list/get/approve/reject), `~/constants/approvalMeta` (`TYPE_META`/`STATUS_TONE`/
>     `REQUEST_TYPE_KEYS`/`STATUS_FILTERS`), and `payloadToView` for the Data section (summary rows for
>     `asset_create`/`asset_transfer`, before→after diff rows for `asset_disposal`/`valuation_exclusion`,
>     with an empty-state when the payload is masked/absent). Category/office FK names resolved via the
>     real `useCategories().tree()` + `useOffices().list({limit:100})` composables (best-effort — a
>     lookup failure falls back to raw ids, never blocks the screen). Pending tab reads the caller's
>     scoped inbox (`GET /requests/inbox`); other tabs (approved/rejected/cancelled/all) read `GET
>     /requests` with a `status` filter; a pending request **not** in the caller's inbox (SoD/scope
>     ineligible) renders a disabled "not eligible" lock instead of decide buttons — `view.eligible`
>     checks membership in the inbox id set, not just `status === 'pending'`. Approve/reject call
>     `POST /requests/:id/approve|reject`, then reload the tab + re-fetch the detail (the decide
>     response is the plain unenriched request row, so the page never renders off it directly).
>     Load-error + retry state added for the inbox/list fetch; a `detailLoading` skeleton covers the
>     detail-pane fetch. `nav.ts`'s `approval` item: removed the mock-era hardcoded `badgeCount: 8` and
>     added `permission: 'request.decide'` — confirmed `AppSidebar.vue` filters nav items on `.permission`
>     via `can()`, so the item now hides for roles without decide rights. Component test rewritten
>     (`test/nuxt/approval.spec.ts`, 14 cases: inbox load/empty/error, tab switching incl. cancelled,
>     detail fetch + payload/timeline rendering, approve/reject with note, not-eligible lock, cancelled
>     neutral result banner, sensitive-type warning banner, approved result banner hides decide buttons,
>     tab switch clears selection). Orphaned mock-era i18n keys (`approval.type.registrasi/penghapusan/
>     peminjaman/maintenance/valuasi`) deleted from both locale files — confirmed nothing (`mock/approval.ts`
>     itself, `useGlobalSearch.ts`, `approval-mock.spec.ts`) does an i18n lookup against them. `test/unit/
>     nav-model.spec.ts`'s stale `badgeCount: 8` assertion updated to assert the new `permission` gate
>     instead. `mock/approval.ts` **retained** — still imported by `useGlobalSearch.ts` for the mock
>     global-search result list (same pattern as the other pending `mock/*` cleanups; drop when global
>     search wires to a real `/search` endpoint, item (f) above).
>     - **Real badge count is still out of scope:** the sidebar no longer shows a hardcoded pending count;
>       a live one needs a global inbox-count store/poll, deferred until there's a cross-page need for it.
>     - **Approved deviations from the mockup** (per the *catat-deviasi* convention), confirmed 1:1
>       against `docs/design/Pengajuan Approval.dc.html` in both light and dark mode: **(a)** a 5th
>       **Dibatalkan (Cancelled)** tab was added (mockup has 4: Menunggu/Disetujui/Ditolak/Semua) —
>       `cancelled` is a real backend `request_status`, so it needed a home in the UI; **(b)** the
>       **Lampiran (attachments)** section is a permanent empty-state ("Tidak ada lampiran.") — the
>       request payload has no attachment/file list yet, so the mockup's file-chip UI has nothing to
>       bind to; **(c)** the type filter lists only the **4 real backend types** (`asset_create`,
>       `asset_disposal`, `asset_transfer`, `valuation_exclusion` → Registrasi/Penghapusan/Mutasi/
>       Pengecualian Valuasi) instead of the mockup's 5 fictional ones — `peminjaman`/`maintenance`
>       have no submit path yet; **(d)** card/detail **titles are built from `type + office`**
>       (`rowTitle()`) rather than an asset/item name, because the list row payload is absent on
>       `GET /requests`/`GET /requests/inbox` (only the detail fetch resolves the full payload).
> 25. ~~**Next session — pick the next real step.**~~ ✅ **Picked (2026-07-04): wire the frontend
>     Mutasi + Penghapusan screens** (candidate (d) — see item 26). Remaining candidates from that
>     session (see *Remaining* below): **(b)** Stock opname backend module; **(c)** Depreciation module;
>     **(e)** Assignment/Maintenance; **(f)** global search backend + drop the last `mock/*` files.
>     **Dev-stack notes from this session's e2e verification (both issues found, fixed, and
>     re-verified — full suite 61/61 green after):**
>     (1) the backend container had drifted to **stale source** (`docker compose ... watch` wasn't
>     actively syncing after a container recreate) — fixed by rebuilding + redeploying the backend
>     image; if e2e results ever look impossible, check container source freshness first.
>     (2) the **Superadmin default (`*`) data-scope policy** was found corrupted to `own` — a
>     parallel-worker run of the Data Scope settings e2e failed mid-mutation and never reverted it
>     (that test mutates live RBAC config as its subject; its cleanup is not failure-safe —
>     **follow-up: make that e2e revert via `afterEach`/API instead of in-test steps**). Restored
>     to `global` (user-approved). (3) local full `pnpm test:e2e` needs `RATELIMIT_ENABLED=false`
>     on the backend (now set via `backend/.env`; CI's e2e job already sets it). (4) the legacy
>     mock-backed approval test in `e2e/operasional.spec.ts` was deleted — superseded by the
>     real-backend `e2e/approval.spec.ts`.
> 26. ~~**Wire the frontend Mutasi Aset + Penghapusan Aset screens**~~ ✅ **DONE (2026-07-05).**
>     Backend additions on this branch first: migration `000022_transfer_condition_return`
>     (`condition_sent`/`transfer_date`/`returned` + `asset_transfers.return_note`); new
>     `POST /transfers/:id/reject-receive` (destination rejects an in-transit shipment → `returned`,
>     asset stays at the origin office, `return_note` recorded); enriched reads for both
>     `internal/transfer` and `internal/disposal` (asset/office/actor names resolved server-side);
>     `GET /approval-thresholds/preview` (submit-side UIs render the approval chain before
>     submitting) plus a plain-decimal hardening fix in the threshold validator that also tightened
>     PR #47's amount validator; OpenAPI synced for all of the above.
>     Frontend: `/transfers` (`app/pages/transfers.vue`) — Ajukan/Kotak Masuk/Riwayat tabs, asset
>     picker restricted to `status=tersedia`, inter-office/inter-region banner, ship + receive (with
>     BAST no.) + reject-receive actions, merged request+transfer history feed; `/disposals`
>     (`app/pages/disposals.vue`) — Ajukan/Riwayat tabs, valuation summary + laba/rugi card, approval
>     chain preview card (via the new preview endpoint), post-submit timeline, Lampirkan BAST on
>     completed rows. Shared: `AssetSearchPicker` component, `officeRegion`/`transferHistory`/
>     `disposalHistory` merge utilities (framework-free, unit-tested), meta constants
>     (`transferMeta`/`disposalMeta`), ~161 new i18n keys (id/en), the caller's `office_id` added to
>     auth state (needed for the inter-region check), and 2 new nav items. Tests: unit (meta,
>     region/merge helpers), `mountSuspended` component specs covering every mockup state (empty/
>     filled/invalid form, inbox empty/populated, gain/loss green/red/masked, chain-card + fallback,
>     post-submit timeline, loading/error/empty on every fetch), and 2 new real-backend e2e specs
>     (`transfers.spec.ts`, `disposals.spec.ts`, 8 tests: full transfer lifecycle incl.
>     reject-receive, full disposal lifecycle incl. BAST attach).
>     **Approved mockup deviations** (catat-deviasi convention, confirmed 1:1 against
>     `docs/design/Mutasi Aset.dc.html` and `docs/design/Penghapusan Aset.dc.html` in both light and
>     dark mode) — **(a)** a **Kirim** button was added to Riwayat (the mockup has no ship UI at
>     all); **(b)** the backend's `in_transit` enum value is localized as **"Dalam Pengiriman"** (the
>     mockup's own alur/status chips show the raw placeholder `in_transfer`, not real i18n);
>     **(c)** disposal method is the real 4-value backend enum `sale`/`auction`/`donation`/
>     `write_off` → **Dijual/Lelang/Hibah/Musnah** (the mockup's fictional "Scrap" is dropped,
>     "Lelang" added; subtitle copy updated to "jual/lelang/hibah/musnah"); **(d)** the fiscal
>     book-value line always renders "—" with its chip (the depreciation module doesn't exist yet,
>     so there is no fiscal value to show); **(e)** history rows that are still approval-request-only
>     (Diajukan/Menunggu/Ditolak/Dibatalkan — no `asset_transfers`/`disposals` row exists yet) render
>     limited info: the asset/method/value columns show "—". Noted during this task's re-verification:
>     the `assetName` resolver for these rows is currently a hard `() => null` stub (no lookup is
>     actually attempted, even though `target_id` is present on the request) — it always falls back

>     **Approved mockup deviations** (catat-deviasi convention, confirmed 1:1 against
>     `docs/design/Depresiasi.dc.html` in both light and dark mode; see spec §6) — **(a)** fully
>     depreciated assets are still shown in the schedule with a Rp 0 expense row (the mockup has no
>     example of this state — added so the KPI/"aset disusutkan: n" preview stays honest, only counting
>     assets with expense > 0); **(b)** the impairment row-action is disabled with a tooltip when the
>     Fiskal basis is active (the mockup doesn't distinguish — PSAK 48 impairment only applies to the
>     commercial basis, fiscal never recognizes it); **(c)** the "periode berjalan belum dihitung"
>     reminder banner is a new element (not in the mockup — a direct consequence of the manual
>     run-model product decision, so operators don't forget to run the period); **(d)** the
>     `book_value_at_disposal` field is gone from the Disposal submit form (server-computed now — a
>     real contract change, not a visual one); **(e)** the Disposal screen's "Jenjang Persetujuan" card
>     subtitle changed from "berdasar nilai perolehan" to **"berdasar nilai buku"** (i18n updated to
>     match the new approval-amount basis).
>     **Honest limitations (follow-up, not this phase)** — **useful-life revision via UI**: the
>     iterative engine already computes prospective effects of a changed estimate correctly, but no
>     endpoint/UI exists yet to edit an asset's useful-life/method/salvage after creation; **opening-
>     balance import**: pre-existing assets are backfilled in full as if the system had run since their
>     purchase date (correct if that matches historical books; importing a *different* historical
>     accumulated balance is not supported); **category-level flat Rp 1 policy**: `default_salvage_rate`
>     is a ratio only — a category-level flat-value override is deferred pending bank policy (existing
>     "Confirm with bank policy" backlog item).
>     **Disposed-asset regeneration rule** (recorded for auditors): once an asset's status flips to
>     `disposed`, `ComputePeriod` stops adding new entries for it after the disposal month, but a
>     **recompute of an already-non-closed period still deletes and does not regenerate** that asset's
>     entries for periods after disposal — history for a disposed asset survives only in periods that
>     were already `closed` before the disposal; a non-closed period's schedule reflects the asset's
>     current (disposed) reality, not a frozen pre-disposal snapshot.
>     **Accounting-policy note (possible future refinement):** the commercial declining-balance method
>     absorbs the entire remainder in the asset's final life month (so closing lands exactly on
>     salvage) — some PSAK declining-balance practice switches to straight-line for the last stretch of
>     an asset's life instead; current behavior is a deliberate, documented simplification, not a bug.
>     **Security follow-up (recorded, not a live gap):** `GET /depreciation/periods` is a global
>     (non-office-scoped) read, safe today because `depreciation.view` is Superadmin-only (global scope
>     by definition) — documented in `handler.go` with a SECURITY NOTE and in the OpenAPI tag. **If**
>     this permission is ever delegated to a non-global/scoped role in the future, the aggregate
>     `asset_count`/`total_amount` summary fields must be scoped or stripped for that role first (they
>     currently reflect the whole fleet, not the caller's office subtree).
>     **Gate sweep (task-13, 2026-07-05):** backend build/vet/test + full `-tags=integration` all green
>     (one `internal/masterdata/floor` testcontainers failure was transient Docker resource contention
>     under concurrent container churn — reran in isolation and it passed); Spectral 0 errors; frontend
>     lint/typecheck/test (882 unit, 84 files)/build all green. Full e2e was run twice: the first pass
>     accidentally auto-parallelized (a pnpm/script quirk swallowed `--workers=1`) and hit only the

>     office picker in `master-offices`/`transfers`, plus the depreciation spec's "reminder banner"
>     assertion failing because this month's period was already computed/closed from earlier manual
>     verification in this same session — both anticipated, not regressions); a second, forced
>     single-worker rerun (after truncating `depreciation.depreciation_entries`/`depreciation_periods`
>     to reset the monthly singleton) surfaced **one more** environmental issue of the same known
>     species as the item-25/26 note: the shared dev-DB's Superadmin default (`*`) data-scope policy
>     was again left at `own` by an incomplete revert in the first run's Data-Scope settings test,
>     which then 403'd every other spec's office-creation setup step (`approval`, `assets`,
>     `depreciation`, `disposals`, `transfers`) plus the pre-existing `master-offices` case — **not**
>     fixed in this task (a direct DB/API mutation to restore it was outside this task's docs-only
>     scope and was correctly declined), so it's recorded here rather than worked around. **Net read:
>     zero e2e failures are attributable to this branch's code** — every failure traces to one of the
>     two pre-existing, previously-documented dev-DB fragilities (office-count debris; the Data-Scope
>     test's non-atomic cleanup) that CI's fresh-database-per-run avoids entirely. Side-by-side against
>     `docs/design/Depresiasi.dc.html` (Playwright MCP, real seeded data, light + dark): header,
>     basis toggle, all 4 KPI tiles, the run panel in all 3 states (open + reminder banner, computed +
>     green "sudah dihitung" note, closed), schedule table anatomy (impaired icon, disabled-fiskal-
>     impairment tooltip, empty-search state), the journal tab (per-GL-account rows + "(tanpa akun

>     `assignment` and needs an `office_id` a Staf would not supply); **(b)** the Staf borrow asset-picker
>     uses `GET /assignments/available` (own-office scoped) because a Staf's `own` data scope makes
>     `GET /assets` empty; **(c)** the "Pengajuan Saya" asset name is a **best-effort client lookup**
>     (`useAssets().get(id)`; a 403 out-of-scope falls back to showing the id/tag) — the `mine` request
>     list/payload never snapshots the asset name server-side; **(d)** check-in "perlu maintenance" only
>     flips the asset to `under_maintenance` (no maintenance record is created — the Maintenance module

>     native `title`, there is no UTooltip infra); **(g)** the Riwayat "Kondisi" column renders as
>     **colored text** (baik/ringan/berat) per the Penugasan mockup, not a badge. **Honest limitations
>     (tracked, not yet done):** the frontend `RequestType` union does **not** yet include `'assignment'`
>     (the `myRequests`/peminjaman path uses a local test cast — small follow-up to add the member); and

>     backend build/vet/test + Spectral (0 errors, the pre-existing unrelated `AssetCreatePayload`
>     warning persists) + frontend lint/typecheck/test/build — see the task-15 report for counts. The
>     `assignment.spec.ts` e2e was **written + committed but not run locally**: this shared dev DB is
>     missing the `assignment.manage` grant for Superadmin/Manager (migration `000005` was amended to

>     multipart) is exercised by unit/component tests but **not** integration-tested end-to-end (would
>     need a MinIO testcontainer harness like the asset-attachments suite); the Laporan tab's "Riwayat
>     Laporan Saya" resolves the reported asset's name via a best-effort client-side `useAssets().get(id)`
>     lookup (same pattern as Assignment's "Pengajuan Saya"), not a server-side snapshot. **Closed
>     follow-up:** the frontend `RequestType` union already included `'assignment'` **and** `'maintenance'`
>     going into this module (the old local test cast is gone). **Bug found while building the e2e, then
>     fixed with a different design after code review:** the Laporan tab's "Aset yang Anda pegang" picker
>     called `GET /assignments?status=active&employee_id=...` with a **client-supplied** `employee_id`. A
>     first fix attempt (migration `000028_assignment_staf_view`) granted Staf `assignment.view` so that
>     call would stop 403ing. Code review caught that this reopened the door wider than intended: with
>     `assignment.view` + the existing office-level data scope, `employee_id` being client-supplied and
>     optional meant any Staf could simply omit it and read **every coworker's assignments in the office**
>     — a regression against PRD §2.2 (Staf = data miliknya) and against 000026's own recorded decision to
>     withhold `assignment.view` from Staf. **Final design (mirrors the `/assignments/available`
>     precedent):** a dedicated `GET /assignments/mine` endpoint, gated by `request.create` (already
>     seeded for Staf in `000005` — **no new permission grant**), which resolves the caller's employee id
>     **server-side** from the JWT-resolved user record (never from the request), so the response can only
>     ever contain the caller's own rows; a caller with no linked employee gets back an empty list (200).
>     Migration `000028` was **deleted** (it had never been applied to the shared dev DB — confirmed via
>     `migrate ... version` = 27 before deletion — so no `down` run was needed). Frontend: `useAssignment().mine()`
>     replaces the `list({ employee_id })` call in `maintenance.vue`; the local employee-id branch/early-return
>     is gone since the server now always resolves it. **New integration coverage**
>     (`internal/assignment/assignment_integration_test.go`): `TestAssignment_Mine_returns_only_caller_own_rows`
>     (two Staf in the same office, each with an active assignment — `Mine` returns only the caller's own
>     row) and `TestAssignment_Staf_role_lacks_assignment_view` (seed-level guard asserting the Staf role
>     still has zero `assignment.view` rows after all migrations — the general `GET /assignments` list
>     route stays 403 for Staf). **Gate sweep:** backend build/vet/test green; `go vet -tags=integration
>     ./...` green; full `-tags=integration ./... -count=1 -p 1` green (all packages); Spectral 0 errors
>     (pre-existing `AssetCreatePayload` warning only); frontend lint/typecheck/test green (1021

>     **E2E status:** the scenario-2 `beforeAll`'s try/catch (previously wrapping both the borrow+approve
>     seeding **and** a permission probe in one block, which could silently self-skip a real regression)
>     was narrowed: since `/assignments/mine` needs only the already-stable `request.create` grant (no
>     migration-timing gap like `assignment.manage`'s — see item 36), the probe is gone and the seeding now

>       (office/employee/reference/category/user) + `useResolveCache`. `master/employees` table → real
>       server-side pagination; **`master/offices` table deferred** (its flat list feeds the office tree —

>       supported `search` for all these resources.
>     - **Part 2 — enriched audit response (item 49(c) "enriched audit response"):** `ListAuditLogs`
>       gained `LEFT JOIN identity.roles` (actor role) + `LEFT JOIN masterdata.offices` (office name),
>       resolution kept **inside the SQL** so an `audit.view`-only viewer isn't blocked by

>       (`AsyncSearchPicker` on users) **gated on `user.manage`** (the picker hits `/users`, which the
>       other `audit.view` roles can't). Actor role is the *current* role (not snapshotted).
>     - **Part 1 — field-permission enforcement (item 49(c) "field-permission enforcement beyond
>       assets+users"):** new fail-closed `authz.FieldService.FilterEntity` helper standardized
>       user/asset/approval masking (**`user` changed fail-open → fail-closed**); **`employees` now

>       coupled masking, mirroring the schedule path; attachment/document maps verified NOT leaks —

>     7 UX/correctness fixes. **(1) Date inputs → Nuxt UI calendar** — new reusable
>     `frontend/app/components/DateField.vue` (ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` v-model, `UInput` + `UCalendar` popover
>     picker; typeable ISO **and** calendar-pick) replaces every native `<UInput type="date">` across 9
>     files (asset form ×2, maintenance record/schedule slideovers, disposals ×2, transfers ×3, assignment
>     ×2, peminjaman, ajukan-peminjaman modal, audit filters ×2). `assignment.vue` date fields gained
>     testids; e2e `assignment.spec` switched off the removed `input[type="date"]` selector. **(2) Pagination
>     — max 3 page buttons** — `TablePagination.vue` rebuilt as a compact sliding window (≤3 numbered
>     buttons centred on current + prev/next chevrons + range text) replacing `UPagination` (reka-ui always
>     renders first+last, so it couldn't be capped). **Follow-up (2026-07-14, branch `fix/unify-pagination`):**
>     the **Katalog Aset** (`pages/assets/index.vue`, table **and** grid views) and **Audit Trail**
>     (`pages/settings/audit.vue`) had their own hand-rolled paginators that enumerated *every* page (Katalog
>     showed 22+ buttons over 63k rows); both now use the shared `TablePagination` via a `pageOffset`
>     writable-computed bridging their 1-based `page` ref to the component's 0-based offset contract. All
>     list screens now share one paginator (master screens already did via `ResourceTable`); the
>     `audit-next-page` testid was replaced by the component's `pagination-next` (spec updated). **Second
>     follow-up (2026-07-14, branch `fix/spa-cache-headers`):** after the unify deploy the catalog still
>     showed the old pagination until a manual hard refresh — the SPA `index.html` shell was served with
>     **no `Cache-Control`**, so the browser heuristically cached a stale shell pointing at the previous
>     build's chunk URLs. Added Nitro `routeRules` in `nuxt.config.ts`: `/_nuxt/**` stays
>     `immutable` (content-hashed), `/**` (the HTML shell) is `no-cache` (always revalidate) — verified via
>     `node .output/server/index.mjs` + curl. New deploys now land without a hard refresh. **(3) i18n `assets.import`** — the Katalog toolbar
>     button used `t('assets.import')`, which resolves to the wizard **namespace object** (a JSON duplicate
>     key: string at top, object at `assets.import.*`) → raw key rendered; renamed the button string to
>     `assets.importBtn` (id/en). **(4) Dashboard refresh icon** — the `:loading` button swapped the
>     refresh glyph for a spinner ("ikon muncul tapi tidak sesuai"); now the `i-lucide-refresh-cw` icon
>     always shows and spins via `animate-spin` while loading. **(5) Collapsed submenu click** — clicking a
>     parent-with-children while the sidebar is collapsed did nothing (children only render when expanded);
>     `onParentClick` now opens the rail (`sidebarCollapsed = false`) **and** expands that group. **(6) Labels
>     under icons when collapsed** — collapsed nav items now stack icon-over-label (`flex-col` + `text-[10px]`
>     truncated label) for leaf, disabled, and parent items. **(7) Thousand separators in reports** — new
>     `formatInt()` in `utils/format.ts` (id-ID grouping, sign-preserving, `—` on invalid) applied to the
>     plain counts in `reports.vue` (KPI default + chart bars + utilization days/loans + maintenance actions
>     + opname total-items/variance) and the 4 stock-opname detail KPIs (total/found/pending/variance);
>     money already grouped via `formatRupiah`/`formatMoneyShort`, dashboard already via `formatCount`.
>     **Notable bug found + fixed during live verification (#6):** adding `truncate` (nowrap) labels made
>     each collapsed item's min-content as wide as its full label; the `<aside>` is a **flex item** with
>     default `min-width:auto`, so it refused to shrink to `w-[76px]` and stayed **264px**. Root cause
>     confirmed empirically in-browser: a bare `width`/`flex-basis` is overridable by the flex row, and the
>     `transition-all` on the rail left the size **stuck at the start value** in the preview pane. Fixed by
>     pinning the rail with inline **`width` + `minWidth` + `maxWidth`** (`sidebarWidth` computed;
>     `max-width` is a hard cap the flex algorithm honours) and narrowing the transition to
>     `transition-colors` so the width change applies instantly (no stuck animation). **Approved deviations /
>     decisions:** **(a)** `DateField` keeps a **typeable ISO text field paired with** the `UCalendar` picker

>     `ListAssetsForScheduleUnion` + `SumAmountsThroughPeriodByAsset`; kept `ListEntriesForPeriod`
>     (journal). Handler gained `limit`/`offset` (default 10, clamp 1–100) + `total`/`limit`/`offset` in
>     the response; OpenAPI updated. Engine now resolves method/life only for the ≤10 page rows. The
>     frontend dropped the separate unfiltered KPI fetch (`loadKpis`) — the single `/schedule` response now
>     carries `kpi` — so the endpoint is called **once** per change (was twice), and server pagination
>     (10/page) bounds the table. **KPI-card overflow (#3):** new `formatRupiahCompact` util (`Rp 1,23 M` /
>     `Rp 3,4 T`) + `min-w-0 truncate` + `:title` full-precision tooltip on the 4 KPI tiles; table totals
>     keep full precision. **Row actions standardized (#1):** new shared `RowActionsMenu` (kebab `⋮`
>     dropdown) + `buildActionGroups` util, extracted from `ResourceTable`, applied with a wrapper-level
>     right-click `UContextMenu` (reset-`contextItems`-on-non-row-target) to all 8 action-bearing tables:
>     assets catalog, transfers, disposals, peminjaman, stock-opname items, reports opname, maintenance
>     records, and depreciation schedule (Impair). Read-only (journal, audit, assignment history, detail
>     sub-tables) + matrix/segmented (data-scope, field-permission) tables intentionally left as-is.
>     **Pagination = 10 (#5):** every list-screen page size set to 10 (`ResourceTable` default, assets,
>     audit, reference, employees, categories 7→10, ImportWizard preview) + composable `?? 20 → ?? 10`
>     fallbacks. Picker/lookup/existence-check limits untouched. **Deviations (recorded):** **(a)** the
>     unified schedule query applies `a.deleted_at IS NULL` uniformly, so entries for **soft-deleted assets
>     no longer appear in the schedule** (the old entry-row query lacked this filter; consistent with the
>     union path) — a deliberate consistency tightening; **(b)** the peminjaman **cancel** action lost its
>     per-row loading spinner (`RowAction` has no `loading` field) — now disabled-while-in-flight,
>     re-entrancy guard intact; **(c)** added **unfiltered** `kpi.asset_count` so the acquisition tile's
>     "n aset" sub-label stays full-set under table filters (matches the documented "tiles never shrink"
>     intent). **Known minor/follow-ups:** orphaned i18n key `impairDisabledFiscalTooltip` now dead (Impair
>     tooltip dropped in the menu conversion); `formatRupiahCompact` renders `Rp 1.000 rb` at 999.999
>     (bucket chosen pre-rounding — documented/tested); a flaky `EnvironmentTeardownError` in

## ✅ Done

### Foundation & DevOps
- [x] Project scaffold (Go/Gin backend, Nuxt 4 frontend)

- [x] **Ops hardening Phase 1 — WAF (Coraza + OWASP CRS)** ✅ custom Caddy image
      (`ops/caddy/`, `xcaddy --with coraza-caddy/v2`), isolated smoke-test harness
      (`ops/caddy/test/`, `ops/waf-smoketest.sh`, host port 18080) proving CRS blocks
      SQLi/XSS/path-traversal while legit traffic passes, prod Caddyfile wired
      DetectionOnly → tuned → **Blocking** (`SecRuleEngine On`, default produksi).
      ADR-0012 + `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` WAF sub-section. **Done (2026-07-06).**
- [x] **Ops hardening Phase 2 — IaC (Ansible)** ✅ `ops/ansible/` playbook: `base`
      (users/ufw/swap/hardening), `docker` (Engine + Compose plugin), `app`
      (`.env.prod` template + `docker compose up --build`, WAF included via the
      `app`-role compose stack — no separate WAF role) roles; idempotent
      (`changed=0` on second run); tooling containerized (`ops/ansible/tools/`,
      host needs only Docker); secrets via Ansible Vault (`*.example` files
      committed, real `inventory.ini`/`vault.yml` gitignored); `ops/ansible/lint.sh`
      (`--syntax-check` + `ansible-lint`) green in CI-less dev. ADR-0013 +
      `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` §15 IaC sub-section. **Done (2026-07-06).**
- [x] **Ops hardening Phase 3 — Monitoring/observability** ✅ self-hosted stack as
      a toggleable compose overlay (`docker-compose.monitoring.yml`): backend RED
      metrics (`/metrics`, internal-only), Prometheus (15d retention + `mem_limit`)
      + exporters (node/cAdvisor/postgres/redis/blackbox), Alertmanager → Telegram,
      Loki+Promtail (log), Grafana (datasource+dashboard as-code) — only Grafana
      public (own subdomain); secrets via `*.example` + gitignore
      (`alertmanager.yml`, `grafana.env`). Ansible `monitoring` role
      (`ops/ansible/roles/monitoring/`) brings the overlay up idempotently via
      `community.docker.docker_compose_v2`, appended after `app` in `site.yml`.
      ADR-0011 + `docs/DEPLOYMENT.md` §16. **Done (2026-07-06). Ops-hardening
      trilogy (WAF → IaC → Monitoring) now COMPLETE.**

### Database (15 migrations · 12 schemas)
- [x] enums + `set_updated_at` + per-module schemas (`shared/identity/audit/masterdata/asset/import/approval/assignment/maintenance/depreciation` + v1.1 `transfer/stockopname/disposal`)
- [x] All tables incl. soft delete, partial-unique, FK indexes, seed (5 roles, 45 RBAC perms)
- [x] **Bank-FAM v1.1 schema baked in** (greenfield) — enums + columns folded into initial migrations
      (`000002`/`003`/`006`/`007`/`008`/`010`/`013`) + new tables `000015_fam_tables` (asset_transfers,
      disposals, stock_opname_*, asset_documents) + app_settings/approval_thresholds/request_approvals.
      `sqlc generate` + build/vet/test + Spectral green; ⚠️ full `migrate up` re-validate on next stack-up

### Backend — Data layer
- [x] pgx pool + Redis client + sqlc models (all tables)
- [x] `/health` (liveness) + `/health/ready` (Postgres + Redis)

### Backend — Identity & Authorization
- [x] Local auth: login, JWT access+refresh (Redis store + denylist), logout, `/auth/me`
- [x] Authorization 3-layer (configurable): RBAC (`role_permissions`), data scope (`data_scope_policies` + office subtree), field permission (`field_permissions`)
- [x] `/auth/permissions`, `/auth/scope/{module}`
- [x] User management (Superadmin): CRUD + field-permission filtering

### Backend — Master Data (all data-scoped & access-controlled)
- [x] Categories (enum/nullable/self-ref/numeric)
- [x] 11 reference resources via generic engine (office-types, departments, positions, units, maintenance/problem categories, brands, vendors, provinces, cities, models)
- [x] Offices (hierarchy) + floors + rooms + employees — **office-subtree scoping** on all ops, IDOR-hardened
- [x] **Masterdata convention refactor** (ADR-0008) — each resource is its own sub-package with the
      four-file split (`office/` · `category/` · `employee/` · `floor/` · `room/`), shared plumbing in
      `common/`, generic engine in `reference/`; thin `masterdata.go` aggregator. Build/vet/test green, no behavior change

### API Documentation
- [x] OpenAPI 3.1 spec + self-hosted Scalar at `/docs` + Spectral lint in CI
- [x] Bruno collection (git-tracked)

### Frontend — foundation & screens (mock-first, built 1:1 with `docs/design`)
- [x] Foundation: SPA shell (`AppSidebar`/`AppTopbar`/`layouts`), design tokens, real backend auth (login + route middleware `can` + `useCan`/`<Can>`), `U*` component library, i18n (id/en), Vitest + Playwright harness
- [x] Dashboard

- [x] **Profil Akun** — `/akun` profile & settings (Profil / Keamanan / Preferensi tabs)
- [x] Mock-first data seam (`mock/*` + `composables/api/use*`) ready to swap to real `$fetch` behind the same interface
- [x] Tests: 387 Vitest unit + `mountSuspended` runtime specs green; lint/typecheck/build gate CI

## ⛔ Remaining

### Bank-FAM (PRD v1.1) — schema done, modules to build

> New scope from the bank pivot. **Schema is built** (see *Database* above); what remains is the
> **backend modules/handlers** + frontend for these features. Enforce data-scope + field-permission on
> every new endpoint (read **and** write); follow the masterdata 4-file split (ADR-0008).

- [x] **Bank-FAM schema** — DONE (greenfield bake-in). New enums + columns folded into the initial
      migrations (`000002`/`000003`/`000006`/`000007`/`000008`/`000010`/`000013`); genuinely-new tables in
      `000015_fam_tables` (`transfer.asset_transfers`, `disposal.disposals`, `stockopname.stock_opname_*`,
      `asset.asset_documents`) + `app_settings`/`approval_thresholds`/`request_approvals`. `sqlc generate`
      + `go build/vet/test` green; `migrate up` validated live (reset via drop-schemas, not `down -all`).
      **Backend handlers** for the new tables (transfer/opname/disposal/documents) still to build.
- [x] **Category enrichment — backend** — `categories` columns (GL account, fiscal group, commercial+
      fiscal useful life, capitalization threshold, asset_class) baked in; `category` service/dto + sqlc +
      OpenAPI wired (build green). **Frontend Kategori screen** still to build (#6 — see *Next session*).
- [x] **Dual-basis depreciation** — commercial (PSAK 16) + fiscal (PMK 72/2023, kelompok 1–4 / bangunan)
      `depreciation_entries` per basis; intangible amortization (PSAK 19); impairment (PSAK 48)
      write-down. `internal/depreciation` module (engine + service + 8 endpoints, migration `000023`) +
      `/depreciation` frontend screen + asset-detail tab + disposal integration. **Done — see item 28
      (2026-07-05).**
- [x] **Value-tiered approval** — `approval_thresholds` (configurable bands per request_type/min-max
      amount/approval_level) + `request_approvals` chain; SoD (maker ≠ checker per step); seeded
      placeholder bands; authz-admin CRUD endpoints for thresholds included. **Done — (2026-06-28).**
- [x] **Asset transfer (mutasi) — backend** — `internal/transfer` module (service/dto/executor/handler/
      routes, ADR-0008 4-file split); `asset_transfer` approval executor creates the `transfers` row only
      on approval (`approved` → `in_transit` → `received` state machine via `POST /transfers/:id/ship`
      and `/receive`); receive atomically relocates the asset (`assets.office_id`/`room_id`) and records a
      `bast_transfer` asset-document (optional MinIO file, best-effort); `transfer.view`/`transfer.manage`
      permissions + `transfers` data-scope module wired; `GET /assets/:id/transfers` history endpoint;
      OpenAPI documented (`Transfer` schema + 6 paths); 15 integration/unit tests (happy path, reject
      leaves no row, submit guards, scope + state-machine, BAST doc creation, asset history), all green.
      **Done — (2026-07-02).** Follow-up additions for the frontend (migration `000022`, reject-receive,
      enrichment, threshold preview) and the **Frontend Mutasi screen** (`/transfers`, 1:1 against
      `docs/design/Mutasi Aset.dc.html`, deviations (a)–(i)) are **done — see item 26** in *Next session*
      above.
- [x] **Stock opname** — sessions + item reconciliation (found/not_found/damaged/misplaced) + report.
      `internal/stockopname` backend (migration `000025`, ADR-0008 4-file split, 11 endpoints, scoped
      read+write, Berita Acara PDF/Excel) + `/stock-opname` frontend screen + real-backend e2e. **Done —
      see item 34 below** (PR pending — branch `feat/stock-opname` not yet merged).
- [x] **Disposal — backend** — `internal/disposal` module (service/dto/executor/handler/routes, ADR-0008
      4-file split); the `asset_disposal` executor was moved out of the asset package into this module's
      own `Executor()`; creates the `disposal.disposals` row only on approval (`assets.status → disposed`),
      with `gain_loss` computed in SQL (`proceeds` − `book_value_at_disposal`); BAST is attached via the
      shared asset-documents mechanism (`bast_disposal` doc type, `related_disposal_id` FK, optional MinIO
      file, best-effort); `disposal.view`/`disposal.manage` permissions + `disposals` data-scope module
      wired on every verb; `GET /assets/:id/disposal` history endpoint; OpenAPI documented (`Disposal`
      schema + 5 paths); 9 integration/unit tests (happy path + gain/loss, gain/loss null when book value
      absent, reject leaves no row, submit guards incl. already-disposed/duplicate/out-of-scope, scoped
      reads, BAST doc + bast_no persistence), all green. **Done — (2026-07-02).** **Deferred:** gain/loss
      GL-account export (journal-ready) and deriving `book_value_at_disposal` server-side from
      depreciation (currently maker-supplied, per the same value-tier caveat as before) — both wait on the
      depreciation module. The **Frontend Disposal screen** (`/disposals`, 1:1 against
      `docs/design/Penghapusan Aset.dc.html`, deviations (a)–(i)) is **done — see item 26** in
      *Next session* above.
- [x] **Asset documents (BAST)** — metadata CRUD + optional MinIO file; scope-gated + audited; integration tests (10 cases). **Done — (2026-06-28).**
- [x] **Journal-ready export (depreciation)** — GL-account rollup of the period's depreciation expense
      (per-category `gl_account_code` debit rows + one accumulated-depreciation credit row, balanced by
      construction) with xlsx (`excelize`) + PDF export. **Done — see item 28 (2026-07-05).**
      ⚠️ **Remaining:** a disposal **gain/loss** GL-account rollup is a separate, not-yet-built export —
      `disposals.gain_loss` exists per-row but there is no journal-recap endpoint/screen for it yet
      (candidate for the Reporting phase or a small disposal follow-up).
- [ ] **Capitalization threshold** — `app_settings` global default + per-category override; below
      threshold → expensed, not capitalized
- [ ] **Confirm with bank policy** — office-tier naming, capitalization amount, approval-limit bands,
      cost-model vs revaluation, exact PSAK paragraphs (PRD ⚠️ items / DATABASE DB-Q6–Q8)

### Backend — Feature modules
- [x] **Asset core** — CRUD read/update (direct, data-scoped + field-permission masking of
      `purchase_cost`/`book_value`/`accumulated_depreciation`); `asset_tag` generator (atomic
      per-office/category/year, Postgres advisory lock); status state machine (valid transitions
      enforced); valuation-exclusion flag. Asset create/disposal/exclusion go through the approval
      engine (not direct write). **Done — (2026-06-28).**
- [x] **Asset attachments (MinIO)** — Storage interface; upload + size/type validation; image thumbnail (original preserved); proxy download/thumbnail; integration-test coverage (MinIO round-trip + scope + rollback). **Done — (2026-06-28).**
- [x] **Barcode / QR** — Code128 + QR PNG from `asset_tag`; scan-lookup `GET /assets/by-tag/:tag`; barcode PNG `GET /assets/:id/barcode`; label PDF `POST /assets/labels` — **BTN template** (QR+logo + bank header + asset code + office/category/name/TP + disclaimer; `company_name`/`disclaimer` from `app_settings`; logo via `LABEL_LOGO_PATH`) + **generic** template; layout **roll** (page-per-label, default 60×24 mm on 64 mm media for Epson C4050) + **sheet** (A4 grid); scope-gated; integration tests. **Done — (2026-06-28).**
- [x] **Approval (maker-checker)** — generic `request_approvals` table; threshold-driven chain
      construction; SoD enforcement (maker cannot approve own request); pull-model eligibility
      (pending step scoped to checker's office); executors: `asset_create`, `asset_disposal`,
      `valuation_exclusion`; authz-admin CRUD endpoints for `approval_thresholds` (Superadmin-gated).
      **Done — (2026-06-28).** Added lightweight `GET /requests/inbox/count` (gate `request.decide`,
      shares `Service.Inbox` — no per-row enrichment/field-filter) to unblock a real sidebar approval
      badge count (frontend wiring still pending — see item 51(c)). Integration test asserts
      `count == len(GET /requests/inbox.data)` for the same caller and 403 for a caller without
      `request.decide`. OpenAPI documented; Spectral 0 errors. **Done (2026-07-13, Tech-Debt Sweep #2
      Task 8).**
- [x] **Assignment** — `internal/assignment` (service/dto/handler/routes + executor, ADR-0008 split) on
      migration `000011_assignment` (one-active-per-asset partial-unique index) + seed `000026`
      (`assignment.view`, `assignments` data-scope, single office-level `assignment` approval band).
      Direct Manager check-out/check-in (`POST /assignments`, `/assignments/:id/checkin` — gated
      `assignment.manage`, atomic asset `available ↔ assigned`/`under_maintenance`) + Staf peminjaman
      (`POST /assignments/borrow` → assignment-type approval request; executor checks out on approval);
      reads `GET /assignments`(+`/available`,`/:id`) & `GET /assets/:id/assignments`; scope enforced read
      **and** write; OpenAPI documented; integration + unit tests green. **Done — (2026-07-08, branch
      `feat/assignment-module`; see item 36 in *Next session* for frontend screens + e2e + deviations).**
- [x] **Maintenance** — `internal/maintenance` (service/dto/executor/handler/routes) on migration
      `000027_maintenance_module` (seeds `maintenance.view` + `maintenance` data-scope + a single
      office-level `maintenance` approval band). 11 endpoints: schedule CRUD (interval/`next_due_date`),
      record CRUD (preventive/corrective, cost, vendor, status state machine, atomic asset
      `available/assigned ↔ under_maintenance`), the "Perlu Tindak Lanjut" attention queue, the Staf
      damage-report submit (maker-checker, duplicate-guarded) whose executor creates the corrective
      record on approval, and per-asset history. Stock-opname "damaged" followup creates a corrective
      record directly (no approval), idempotent via `followup_record_id`. Scope enforced read **and**
      write; OpenAPI documented; integration tests green. Frontend: **`/maintenance`** (Jadwal/Catatan/
      Laporan Kerusakan tabs) + Detail-Aset "Riwayat Maintenance" tab; real-backend e2e. **Done —
      (2026-07-11, branch `feat/maintenance-module`; see item 38 in *Next session* for the full
      deviation list, honest limitations, and the `assignment.view`-for-Staf bug found + fixed.)**
- [ ] **Depreciation** — book value (straight-line / declining-balance); monthly `depreciation_entries` read model
- [x] **Reporting & Dashboard** — `internal/report` (migration `000029`; 4 endpoints; dashboard summary Redis-cached 90s, reports/exports always fresh); **7 report types** incl. the disposal gain/loss **GL recap** (closes the old disposal deferral); `excluded_from_valuation` counted-but-not-valued; xlsx/pdf export via the `columnsFor` seam; both frontend pages wired (`mock/dashboard.ts`+`mock/reports.ts` deleted); `PeriodFilter` = first `UCalendar`-range component. **Done (2026-07-12, branch `feat/reporting-dashboard`) — see items 42/43 in *Next session*** for the full deviation list (a)–(j) + honest limitations. Aggregates still run **directly over the OLTP tables** — the pre-aggregated OLAP read layer stays deferred (see *Analytics / OLAP* below).
- [ ] **Bulk import** — CSV/XLSX (assets + master data); `import_jobs`; per-row validation + error report

### Analytics / OLAP (large-data plan)

> Dashboard & Reporting currently aggregate **directly over the OLTP tables**. As assets,
> assignments, maintenance records, depreciation entries, and audit logs grow, those scans get
> slow and contend with transactional writes. Plan: add a dedicated **analytical read layer**
> kept separate from the write path (OLTP stays the source of truth; OLAP is a derived read model).

- [ ] **`analytics` schema (star schema)** — dimension tables (`dim_office`, `dim_category`, `dim_status`, `dim_date`) + fact tables (`fact_asset_snapshot`, `fact_assignment`, `fact_maintenance_cost`, `fact_depreciation`). `depreciation.depreciation_entries` is the first instance of such a derived read model and sets the pattern.
- [ ] **Population via the in-process scheduler** — periodic rollups (nightly/hourly) transform OLTP → facts, incremental where possible. Start with **materialized views** (scheduled `REFRESH`) for moderate scale; graduate to maintained fact tables once volume warrants it.
- [ ] **Reporting/Dashboard read from OLAP** — scoped by office (reuse data-scope on dimension keys), keeping report queries cheap and OLTP writes fast. Keep the read API stable so the backing store can change transparently.
- [ ] **Escalation path (only if needed)** — a column-store / external OLAP engine (e.g. DuckDB or ClickHouse) for very large volumes; introduce only when materialized views + fact tables on Postgres stop scaling.

### Global search (topbar)

> The topbar has a global-search input (placeholder wired in the app shell) but no backend. Plan a
> cross-entity **command palette** (⌘K) that searches assets, employees, offices, users, and requests,
> **respecting the caller's data-scope + field-permission**, returning typed/grouped results that
> deep-link to the record.

- [x] **Frontend — command palette** — overlay (⌘K/topbar), grouped results, keyboard nav, recent
      searches, empty/loading states (built in the foundation phase, mock-backed); **wired to the real
      `GET /search` with a 250 ms debounce** — item 40. **Done (2026-07-11).**
- [x] **Backend `GET /search?q=`** — `internal/search`: per-entity fan-out (assets/employees/offices/
      users/requests), **scope-filtered** (per-module `CallerOfficeScope`) + permission-gated (groups
      silently omitted), 5 items + total per group. `types=` param dropped (UI has no per-type filter);
      field-permission filtering not needed — items expose only non-sensitive columns (name/code/tag/
      email). **Done (2026-07-11) — item 40.**
- [x] **Indexing / scale (phase 1)** — `pg_trgm` GIN indexes (migration `000028`) chosen over
      `tsvector` (substring match on short names/codes, not document search). Deferred until volume/
      ranking demand it: `unaccent`, cross-entity ranking, dedicated engine (Meilisearch/Typesense/
      Elasticsearch via scheduler/CDC — shares the indexing story with *Analytics / OLAP* above).

### Backend — Cross-cutting
- [x] **Audit logging** — `internal/audit` writer wired into every masterdata + user mutation (create/update/delete) with before/after diffs; office-scoped, filterable `GET /api/v1/audit` (gated by `audit.view`); migration 000014 adds `audit_logs.office_id`. (This is the **business audit trail** — distinct from application/observability logging below.)
- [x] **Structured logging & request correlation (ADR-0002)** — `log/slog` logger (JSON in prod, text in dev),
      slog-backed request middleware (method/path/status/latency) replacing `gin.Logger()`, a **request-id**
      middleware reading/echoing `X-Request-ID` (CORS allow/expose-listed) and binding `request_id`/`user_id`/`role_id`
      to every line, a context-carried logger, and a `safeAttrs` redaction helper (`password_hash`/tokens/`google_id`).
      Frontend `useLogger` propagates `X-Request-ID` per API call and ships client errors. **Done — PR #18.**
- [x] **Google OAuth2 login (ADR-0009, link-only)** — `/auth/google` + callback via `golang.org/x/oauth2` +
      `coreos/go-oidc/v3`: OIDC authorization-code + **PKCE (S256)**, single-use Redis state, ID-token verify
      (audience pinned, `email_verified` required), **link-only** account linking by verified email (no
      auto-provision), mints the same app JWT (refresh in **httpOnly cookie**). Feature-gated off without
      `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`. **Done — PR #21** (setup guide #22, Docker env fix #23; see `docs/google-oauth-setup.md`).
- [x] **Refresh token in httpOnly cookie (C1)** — refresh moved out of the JS-readable body into an
      HttpOnly/SameSite cookie scoped to `/api/v1/auth`; access token stays in memory. **Done — PR #20.**
- [ ] **Password reset / email verification** — Redis-TTL tokens (+ email later)
- [x] **Rate limiting (ADR-0004)** — Redis token-bucket (`go-redis/redis_rate`): per-IP + per-account login
      bands, global + refresh throttles, trusted-proxy client-IP hardening; configurable, fail-open. **Done — PR #19.**
- [ ] **Notifications (in-app)** — store + endpoints (approval decisions, maintenance reminders)
- [ ] **Scheduler** — automated triggers for periodic jobs (monthly depreciation compute/close,
      maintenance-due reminders). Superseded by **ADR-0010** (staged adoption, 2026-07-05): stage 1
      (manual HTTP/UI trigger — "Hitung Periode"/"Tutup Periode", idempotent + `pg_advisory_xact_lock`
      + audit-logged) is **done** as part of the depreciation module (item 28); this checklist item now
      tracks **stage 2** (`cmd/jobs` binary + external scheduler — Task Scheduler/cron/K8s CronJob — +
      a `job_runs` table) and **stage 3** (in-process advisory-locked scheduler or a Redis job queue for
      multi-replica scale), neither built yet. Period **close** stays manual by product decision
      (accounting discipline, not a technical gap) regardless of stage.
- [x] **Authorization admin endpoints** — `internal/authzadmin` — role CRUD (system-role protected), replace-set role_permissions/data_scope/field_permissions with Redis cache invalidation (ScopeService/FieldService gained `Invalidate`), canonical permission catalog (`GET /authz/catalog`). **Done — (2026-06-28).**
- [x] **Seed RBAC drift fix** — stale permission keys (`asset.read`/`asset.create`/`request.approve`) realigned to the canonical catalog (`asset.view`/`asset.manage`, `request.decide`, `approval.config.manage`); seed script and migration re-verified against `permissionCatalog`. **Done — (2026-06-28).**

### Frontend (screens built mock-first — remaining work)
- [ ] **API composable convention refactor** (ADR-0007) — (a) rename Indonesian DTO field keys to the
      backend's English `snake_case` contract (start `useOffices`/`Office`/mock store), (b) regroup
      `composables/api/` + `mock/` into module subfolders (masterdata/asset/identity/operational/reporting).
      Do before wiring screens to real APIs to avoid a mapping shim; keep lint/typecheck/test green.
- [x] **Kategori Aset screen** (#6) — built mock-first 1:1 from `docs/design/Kategori Aset.dc.html`:
      `app/pages/master/categories.vue` + `useCategories` + `components/category/CategoryFormSlideover.vue`
      + i18n + tests. Rich form carries the bank-FAM fields (asset_class, commercial+fiscal depreciation,
      GL account, fiscal group, capitalization threshold). ✅ **Wired to `/api/v1/masterdata/categories`** (CRUD + `GET /categories/tree` for full unpaginated set; client-side tree/filter/pagination retained; orphaned `mock/categories.ts` deleted). **Done (2026-06-29).**
- [ ] **Wire screens to real backend APIs** — replace `mock/*` fixtures with real `$fetch` behind the
      existing `composables/api/use*` interface, as each backend module lands; field-permission-aware forms
  - [x] **Peran & RBAC** (`/settings/rbac`) → wired to `/authz` (catalog + roles + role-permissions);
        English DTO; UUID `id` identity; system-role permissions editable per product decision; e2e updated. **Done (2026-06-28).**
  - [x] **Data Scope** (`/settings/data-scope`) → wired to `/authz` (catalog scope_modules + per-role scope policies);
        English DTO; UUID `id` identity; save only changed roles (dirtyIds); e2e spec updated against real seeded backend; orphaned mock deleted. **Done (2026-06-28).**
  - [x] **Field Permission** (`/settings/field-permission`) → wired to `/authz/roles` + `/authz/roles/:id/fields`; catalog
        `assets`+`users` (English field keys); UUID `id` identity; default-allow; save preserves other-entity rows + only PUTs changed roles; e2e spec added against real seeded backend; orphaned `mock/fieldPermission.ts` deleted. **Done (2026-06-28).** ⚠️ TODO: `FilterView` enforcement now also covers `requests` (see the Pengajuan & Approval entry below); remaining: `employees` + other masterdata entities.
  - [x] **Audit Trail** (`/settings/audit`) ✅ wired to `GET /api/v1/audit` — server-side filter + pagination (limit/offset); gate `audit.view`; entity-type filter from frontend `AUDIT_ENTITY_TYPES` catalog; expandable diff viewer; e2e spec against real backend; orphaned `mock/audit.ts` deleted. **Done (2026-06-29).** ⚠️ TODO: actor filter + role/summary/office-name columns dropped — backend response has no role/summary; resolving actor/office names requires `user.manage`/masterdata reads that an `audit.view`-only viewer may lack. Revisit if a viewer-accessible name lookup or enriched audit response lands.
  - [x] **User Management** (`/settings/users`) ✅ wired to `/api/v1/users` — CRUD (GET list with server-side search+pagination, POST create, PUT update, DELETE remove); gate `user.manage`; role/office/employee pickers from real API lookups; employee picker filtered by selected office (office_id-aware `employeeFormOptions`); e2e spec against real seeded backend; status toggled via update endpoint. **Done (2026-06-29). Authz/settings screen wiring batch complete (RBAC + Data Scope + Field Permission + Audit Trail + User Management).** Filter bar now has server-side role/office/status filter controls (role `USelect`, office `AsyncSearchPicker`, status `USelect`, reset button matching the mockup) driving `GET /users?role_id&office_id&status`; `useUsers().list()` extended; 12-case component spec (`users-filters.spec.ts`); verified live against the real backend. **Done (2026-07-13, Tech-Debt Sweep #2 Task 7).** ⚠️ TODO: reset-password action still dropped pending backend support; office/employee lookup capped at 100 (searchable async picker is a follow-up if counts grow); `mock/users.ts` retained until `useGlobalSearch` is wired to the real `/search` endpoint; no dedicated e2e assertion added yet for the new filter controls (component-test only).
- [x] **Peta Lokasi** (`/master/map`) ✅ wired to `GET /api/v1/offices/map` — office lat/lng columns + geo endpoint with resolved type/province/city names + per-office asset count; data-scoped. `useOfficeMap` rewritten (real `$fetch`); types `MapOffice`/`OfficeTier`; 3-tier legend (Pusat/Wilayah/Cabang; Outlet folded into Cabang — `office_types.tier` not yet editable); coord-filtered Leaflet pins; load-error/retry; e2e spec added; orphaned `mock/officeMap.ts` deleted. **Done (2026-06-29).** ⚠️ TODO: map shows empty-state until offices have coordinates (no production seed); asset count real but 0 until asset module populated. (`office_types.tier` now editable via Referensi screen — resolved as part of §Referensi wiring below.)
- [x] **Master Data Referensi** (`/master/reference`) ✅ wired to generic reference engine (`GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/v1/masterdata/reference/:resource`) — 11 resources (office-types, departments, positions, units, maintenance-categories, problem-categories, brands, vendors, provinces, cities, models); FK pickers (cities→provinces, models→brands); `office-types` `tier` editable (select: pusat/wilayah/office) — **office map now meaningful** (tier settable → real Pusat/Wilayah/Cabang pins); `vendors` gains `contact_name` + `address` fields; `is_active` toggle/column hidden for provinces & cities (no `is_active` column); `departments` `code` field restored; `brands` label corrected to "Brand". Backend: `typeEnum` + `tier` column in reference engine. Orphaned `mock/reference.ts` deleted; e2e spec added (`frontend/e2e/master-reference.spec.ts`). **Done (2026-06-29).** ⚠️ TODO: cities and models need at least one province/brand created first (no production seed); empty FK picker shows a warning.
- [x] **Pegawai** (`/master/employees`) ✅ wired to `GET/POST/PUT/DELETE /api/v1/employees` — server-enforced `employees` data-scope; `useEmployees` composable rewritten (real `$fetch`, CRUD); `Employee`/`EmployeeInput` English DTO; UUID FK pickers for office (required), department, position with table name-resolution; inline `GET /offices?limit=100` for office options; backend `phone` column added (migration + DTO + query + OpenAPI); `data-testid` on office/dept/position USelects; e2e spec (`frontend/e2e/employees.spec.ts`); mockup comparison 1:1 (7 cols, 4-filter bar, slideover); `mock/employees.ts` retained (still used by `useGlobalSearch`). **Done (2026-06-30).** ⚠️ TODO: `mock/employees.ts` — delete when `useGlobalSearch` is wired to real `/search` endpoint.
- [x] **Kantor + Lantai + Ruangan** (`/master/offices`) ✅ wired to `/api/v1/offices` + `/api/v1/floors` (`?office_id=`) + `/api/v1/rooms` (`?floor_id=`) — split-panel tree (built client-side from the flat scoped list) + detail + inline floor/room CRUD; server-enforced `offices` data-scope. `useOffices`/`useFloors` rewritten (real `$fetch`); `Office`/`Floor`/`Room` English DTO; FK pickers (office-type/province/city via `useReference`, city filtered by province) + optional `latitude`/`longitude` inputs (product decision → Peta Lokasi pins); tree icon/colour from office-type **tier** (`tierMeta`); FK id → name resolution in detail; floor/room updates resend required `office_id`/`floor_id`; load-error/retry; `data-testid` on office-type/province/city USelects. Deleted `mock/floors.ts` + `floors-mock.spec.ts` + `offices-mock.spec.ts`; `mock/offices.ts` retained (decoupled `MockOffice`, used by `useGlobalSearch`). Unit + 20-case component spec + real-backend e2e (create office-type via Referensi → create office). **Done (2026-07-02). Master-data screen-wiring batch complete.** ⚠️ TODO: delete `mock/offices.ts` when `useGlobalSearch` is wired to real `/search`.
- [x] **Assets cluster** (`/assets`, `/assets/:tag`, `/assets/:tag/edit`, `/assets/label`, `/assets/new`) ✅
      wired to real `/api/v1/assets` + `/api/v1/requests` — Katalog: server-side list/search/filter +
      FK name resolution (category/office/brand/model); Detail: `GET /assets/by-tag/:tag`,
      field-permission money masking (`purchase_cost`/`accumulated_depreciation`/`book_value`), real
      attachments gallery, tab empty-states for the not-yet-built Assignment/Maintenance/Depreciation
      modules; Form: **create submits `POST /requests` type `asset_create`** (maker-checker — no direct
      create endpoint), edit is restricted to mutable fields via `PUT /assets/:id` (only `office_id`,
      `purchase_cost`, `asset_class`, `status` and `tag` stay read-only post-creation — `purchase_date`
      IS editable in edit mode); Label/Barcode: real barcode/label-PDF endpoints
      (`GET /assets/:id/barcode`, `POST /assets/labels`). `AssetCreatePayload` (backend) widened to the
      full create-form field set. Real-backend e2e rewritten (`frontend/e2e/assets.spec.ts`): API setup
      (office/floor/room/category prereqs, unique per run) → submit `asset_create` → approve as a second
      SoD-eligible user (maker ≠ checker) → UI assertions across Katalog/Detail/Edit/Label + the
      `/assets/new` form flow (verified via a follow-up API call) + a negative empty-state search.
      **Done (2026-07-04).**
      ⚠️ **Deliberate deferrals:** Import wizard still mock (no backend bulk-import endpoint); Approval
      screen still mock (only the submit call is wired — see *Next session* above); asset delete is out
      of scope here — deletion goes through the Disposal screen/module; **field "Pemegang" (holder)
      dropped from the Form** per user decision (holder assignment belongs to the future Penugasan
      module) — Katalog's "Pemegang" column shows "—" until that module lands.
      ✅ **RESOLVED (2026-07-04) — security follow-up from the branch's final review:** the approval
      submit used to trust the client-supplied `amount` without cross-checking `payload.purchase_cost` —
      a maker could send `amount: "0"` with a huge `purchase_cost` and route an `asset_create` through
      the lowest approval band. Fixed in `SubmitRequest.validate()` (`internal/approval/dto.go`): for
      `asset_create`, `amount` must **numerically** equal `payload.purchase_cost` (big.Rat comparison, so
      `"1000"` == `"1000.00"`), or equal 0 when the payload carries no `purchase_cost`; malformed
      payload/amount/cost strings are rejected too → 400. Unit-tested (12 table cases + other-types
      passthrough); OpenAPI `SubmitRequest.amount` description updated. (The disposal
      `book_value_at_disposal` sibling caveat still waits on the depreciation module.)
      ✅ **Partly resolved (2026-07-12, item 42):** the mock Laporan screen is gone — `pages/reports.vue`
      is wired to the real `/reports` API and `mock/reports.ts` is **deleted**, so the old-key coupling no
      longer blocks a wiring. **Remaining standalone cleanup:** tighten `AssetStatusBadge`'s prop from
      `AssetStatus | string` to `AssetStatus` and drop the badge's `?? assets.status.${status}`
      legacy-status fallback; and extract a shared `moneyCell`/rupiah formatter util (now duplicated across
      Katalog/Detail/AssetForm/reports — the reports page reuses `formatMoneyShort` from `reportMeta`).
      🐛 **Bug fixed during verification:** `pages/assets/[tag].vue` + the `pages/assets/[tag]/` folder
      made `[tag].vue` an unintended parent route for `[tag]/edit.vue` (no `<NuxtPage/>` to render the
      child), so `/assets/:tag/edit` silently showed the Detail page. Fixed by moving `[tag].vue` →
      `[tag]/index.vue` (siblings).
- [x] **Pengajuan & Approval** (`/approval`) ✅ wired to real `/api/v1/requests` — inbox
      (`GET /requests/inbox`, scoped to the caller's pending steps) + list-by-status
      (`GET /requests` with a `status` filter) for the other four tabs; detail fetch resolves the
      full payload + approval-step timeline; approve/reject via `POST /requests/:id/approve|reject`;
      a pending request outside the caller's inbox (SoD/scope-ineligible) renders a disabled
      "not eligible" lock instead of decide buttons. Category/office FK names resolved via
      `useCategories().tree()` + `useOffices().list()` (best-effort, falls back to raw ids).
      Backend: `internal/approval` responses enriched with maker/office names + the full payload
      (`enrichRequestMap`), and **field-permission `FilterView` now covers the `requests` entity**
      (first entity beyond `assets`/`users`). `nav.ts`'s `approval` item: removed the mock-era
      hardcoded `badgeCount: 8`, gated on `permission: 'request.decide'`. Component test suite
      rewritten (`test/nuxt/approval.spec.ts`, 14 cases). `mock/approval.ts` **retained** — still
      imported by `useGlobalSearch.ts` for the mock global-search result list (drop when global
      search wires to a real `/search` endpoint, item (f) in *Next session*). **Done (2026-07-04).**
      See item 24/25 in *Next session* above for the full deviation list (a)–(d) and the dev-stack
      issues found & fixed during this task's e2e verification (stale container source; corrupted
      Superadmin data-scope from a flaky settings e2e; RATELIMIT_ENABLED=false for local e2e).
      Full local e2e re-verified green (61/61) after the fixes.
- [x] **Mutasi Aset** (`/transfers`) + **Penghapusan Aset** (`/disposals`) ✅ wired to real
      `/api/v1/transfers` + `/api/v1/disposals` (+ `/api/v1/requests` for submit/approve and the new
      `/api/v1/approval-thresholds/preview` for the pre-submit chain preview). Mutasi: Ajukan/Kotak
      Masuk/Riwayat tabs, asset picker restricted to available assets, inter-office/inter-region
      banner, ship + receive (BAST no.) + reject-receive actions, merged request+transfer history.
      Disposal: Ajukan/Riwayat tabs, valuation summary + laba/rugi card, approval-chain preview card,
      post-submit timeline, Lampirkan BAST on completed rows. Shared `AssetSearchPicker` +
      `transferHistory`/`disposalHistory`/`officeRegion` utilities; caller `office_id` added to auth
      state. Backend companions on this branch: migration `000022` (condition/transfer_date/return),
      `POST /transfers/:id/reject-receive`, enriched transfer+disposal reads, threshold preview
      endpoint. 2 new real-backend e2e specs (8 tests). **Done (2026-07-05).** See item 26 in
      *Next session* above for the full deviation list (a)–(i) and follow-ups (disposal amount basis
      → server-computed book value; BAST link once Dokumen BAST exists; money fields into the
      field-permission catalog if needed).
- [x] **Depresiasi** (`/depreciation`) ✅ wired to real `/api/v1/depreciation/*` +
      `/api/v1/assets/:id/depreciation` + `/api/v1/assets/:id/impairment` — basis toggle (Komersial
      PSAK 16 / Fiskal PMK 72/2023), 4 KPI tiles, Jalankan-Periode panel (open/computed/closed +
      reminder banner), Jadwal-per-Aset tab (impaired icon, fully-depreciated rows, filters), Rekap
      Siap-Jurnal tab (balanced banner + xlsx/pdf export), impairment modal (live loss preview); asset
      detail's Depreciation tab now shows a real schedule instead of an empty state; Disposal screen's
      fiscal valuation + approval-chain subtitle are real. **Done (2026-07-05).** See item 28 in
      *Next session* above for the full deviation list (a)–(e), limitations, and follow-ups.
- [x] **Stock Opname** (`/stock-opname`) ✅ wired to real `/api/v1/stockopname/*` — list (empty/loading/
      error+retry/populated with per-session progress) + detail toggle covering all 4 session states
      (`open`/`counting`/`reconciling`/`closed`), scan bar + manual code entry, segmented per-item
      result buttons while counting (read-only badges once reconciling/closed), variance panel with
      follow-up buttons (`not_found` → disposal, `misplaced` → transfer, `damaged` disabled/coming-soon),
      create/finish (Berita Acara PDF/Excel preview) modals. `useStockOpname` composable;
      `stockOpnameMeta` constants; `SessionCard`/`StockopnameCreateSessionModal`/
      `StockopnameFollowupModal` components. Real-backend e2e (`frontend/e2e/stock-opname.spec.ts`,
      1/1). **Done (2026-07-07).** See item 34 in *Next session* above for the full deviation list
      (a)–(d) and follow-ups (no submitted-state indicator on the follow-up button; e2e session
      creation goes via API due to the office-picker `limit:100` cap).
- [x] **Assignment (Penugasan/Peminjaman)** (`/assignment` + `/peminjaman` + Detail-Aset borrow) ✅ wired
      to real `/api/v1/assignments/*` + `/api/v1/requests?type=assignment`. **`/assignment`** (Manager,
      gated `assignment.manage`) — Check-out / Check-in / Riwayat tabs (active-count badge, colored
      condition column, load-error/retry), 1:1 against `docs/design/Penugasan Aset.dc.html`;
      check-out/check-in atomically flip the asset (`available ↔ Digunakan`/`Maintenance`).
      **`/peminjaman`** (Staf, gated `request.create`) — inline Ajukan Peminjaman form + "Pengajuan Saya"
      list (expandable approval timeline + cancel); asset picker from `GET /assignments/available`
      (own-office scoped). **Detail-Aset "Ajukan Peminjaman"** button + `AssignmentAjukanPeminjamanModal`
      (locked-asset variant), shown for all `request.create` roles, disabled (native `title` hint) when
      the asset is not available. `useAssignment` composable; `assignmentMeta` constants; full i18n id/en.
      963 unit/component tests green. Real-backend e2e (`frontend/e2e/assignment.spec.ts`): direct Manager
      check-out → Aktif + Detail "Digunakan" + borrow disabled → check-in → Dikembalikan; Staf peminjaman
      submit → Menunggu → approve via API (maker ≠ checker, office-level) → Disetujui + assignment created;
      empty-Alasan negative. **Done (2026-07-08, branch `feat/assignment-module`).** See item 36 in
      *Next session* for the full deviation list (a)–(g), honest limitations (frontend `RequestType` union
      lacks `'assignment'` — local test cast, follow-up; no real nav badge count), and the note that the
      e2e is written + committed but not run locally (stale dev-DB missing the `assignment.manage` seed
      grant — CI's fresh-DB e2e covers it).
- [x] **Maintenance** (`/maintenance` + Detail-Aset "Riwayat Maintenance" tab) ✅ wired to real
      `/api/v1/maintenance/*` + `/api/v1/requests?type=maintenance`, 1:1 against
      `docs/design/Maintenance.dc.html` (due banner, Jadwal/Catatan/Laporan Kerusakan tabs, light + dark
      verified). Jadwal — schedule cards with due badges + "Buat Catatan" quick-create; Catatan — 7-column
      table (Aset/Tipe/Kategori/Tanggal/Status/Biaya/Vendor), row-click edit; Laporan Kerusakan (Staf) —
      asset + kategori masalah picker, photo upload, "Riwayat Laporan Saya". `MaintenanceScheduleSlideover`
      + `MaintenanceRecordSlideover`; `useMaintenance` composable; `maintenanceMeta` constants; full i18n
      id/en. 1021 unit/component tests green. Real-backend e2e (`frontend/e2e/maintenance.spec.ts`):
      Manager schedule→"Buat Catatan"→`in_progress`→`completed` (+biaya, next-due shift, asset
      Maintenance→Tersedia); Staf report→approve (maker ≠ checker)→corrective record; negative
      empty-kategori + read-only-completed-record. **Done (2026-07-11, branch
      `feat/maintenance-module`).** See item 38 in *Next session* for the full deviation list (a)–(h),
      honest limitations, and a real permission bug found + fixed (`assignment.view` missing for Staf,
      blocking the Laporan asset picker — migration `000028` + an `employee_id`-scoped frontend fix). The
      e2e's Staf→approve scenario self-skips locally (this shared dev DB predates migration `000028`);
      the other two scenarios pass locally; CI's fresh DB runs all three.
- [ ] **Staff role menus** — wire staff nav (`myAssets`, staff `assignment`/`approval`) to pages/variants
- [x] **Google OAuth login** button + flow (UI) — login redirect + `?oauth=success/error` landing
      (refresh → fetchMe → navigate; i18n error reasons). **Done — PR #21.**
- [x] **Profil & Pengaturan Akun** (`nav.profile` + `nav.accountSettings`) — built at `app/pages/account.vue` (`/akun`, Profil / Keamanan / Preferensi tabs) from `docs/design/Profil Akun.dc.html`; see *Done → Frontend*. (Checkbox was stale — screen and mockup both exist.)
- [ ] **E2E coverage** — Playwright specs for Dashboard, Assets, Settings, RBAC, Operasional clusters
      (currently only `login` + `master-offices`)
- [ ] Live light/dark visual pass for auth-gated screens (pending a stable backend to log in)

### Quality
- [x] Backend testing stack (ADR-0001): testify + testcontainers-go; `internal/testsupport` (Postgres/Redis containers, migration apply, `Reset`, seed helpers) + `backend-integration` CI job (`-tags=integration`, runs every PR; default `go test ./...` stays unit-only via the build tag).
- [x] Backend integration suites (real Postgres/Redis, behind `//go:build integration`):
      - **Masterdata data-scope:** office (#24), employee (#25), floor (#26), room — transitive floor→office scope (#26).
      - **Authz:** `ScopeService.Resolve` — 4 levels + fallback + Redis caching (#25); field-permission `ForEntity`/`FilterView` + caching (#26).
      - **Cross-module:** audit office-scoped `List` + `Log`/`Diff` round-trip (#27); reference engine generic CRUD + `coerce` (white-box) (#27).
      - **Approval engine + asset core** (#28 ← task-21): 11 approval scenarios (3-step chain, SoD, reject mid-chain, disposal/exclusion with cross-office security bypass, cancel, scope filter, threshold edit, executor atomicity/rollback) + 4 asset scenarios (field masking by role, tag atomicity sequential + per-year, read scope). 15 integration tests, all PASS.
      - **Asset attachments (MinIO)** (task-11): image round-trip, PDF upload, oversize rejection, disallowed type, scope enforcement, DB rollback (no orphan in MinIO). 6 integration tests (MinIO testcontainer), all PASS.
      - **Barcode / QR + label PDF** (task-9): Code128 PNG, QR PNG, BTN + generic label PDF (roll + sheet), scan-lookup, scope gate. Integration tests (`-tags=integration`) green.
      - **Asset documents (BAST)** (task-5): list, create, get, update, delete, file-upload (multipart), file-download; scope-gated + audited; rollback on MinIO failure. 10 integration tests (MinIO testcontainer), all PASS.
      - Remaining backend targets (minor): category sub-package, full HTTP+JWT request path.
- [ ] Optional seed data (provinces/cities, office types, etc.)

## Suggested order
1. **Audit logging** (cross-cutting — wire before more mutations accrue)
2. **Asset core + attachments (MinIO) + barcode**
3. **Approval (maker-checker)** → **Assignment** → **Maintenance**
4. **Depreciation** → **Reporting/Dashboard (+ PDF/Excel)** → **Import** — add the **Analytics / OLAP** read layer (materialized views → fact tables) once report data volume warrants it
5. ~~Structured logging (ADR-0002) + Google OAuth2 (ADR-0009) + rate limiting (ADR-0004)~~ ✅ **done (PR #18/#19/#21)** — remaining cross-cutting: **notifications + scheduler + authz admin endpoints**
6. **Wire the (already-built) frontend screens to real APIs** as each backend module lands —
   swap `mock/*` for real `$fetch` behind the same `composables/api/use*` interface
